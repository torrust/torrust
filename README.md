### Need

The reason behind this project was that Nautilus Cyberneering GmbH needed a solution that makes it easy for anyone with a computer and internet connection to share their files with the rest of the world.

### Approach

We will develop a BitTorrent tracker with a private and public tracker option and a web application for uploading and downloading torrents that are being tracked by the BitTorrent tracker.

### Benefit

Anyone will be able to host a (private) BitTorrent tracker and online torrent index with ease. And now they can share their digital content on their own torrent index :).

### Project Structure

- [__Backend__](https://github.com/torrust/torrust/tree/main/backend): A REST API written in Rust with the Actix web framework that acts as a backend for the web application.
- [__Frontend__](https://github.com/torrust/torrust/tree/main/frontend): A Vue application that acts as a frontend for the web application.
- [__Torrust Tracker__](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker): A UDP and HTTP based torrent tracker built with Rust.
- [__Torrust Documentation__](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-documentation): A website made with MkDocs that hosts all the Torrust documentation.
